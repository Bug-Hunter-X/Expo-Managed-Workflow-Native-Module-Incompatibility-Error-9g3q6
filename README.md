# Expo Managed Workflow Native Module Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Expo's managed workflow with native modules. The error message is often vague, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Problem

Attempting to use a native module (one requiring direct interaction with Android or iOS code) within an Expo managed workflow project leads to a build failure. Expo's managed workflow aims to abstract away the complexities of native development, and some modules might clash with this abstraction.

## Solution

The most effective solution is typically to find an alternative module compatible with Expo's managed workflow. If that's impossible, you might need to eject from the managed workflow to a bare workflow, allowing for direct interaction with native code.  This requires significantly more setup and native code knowledge.
