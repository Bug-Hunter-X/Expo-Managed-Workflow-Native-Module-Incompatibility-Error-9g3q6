The solution depends on the specific native module causing the problem.  There are three common approaches:

1. **Find an Expo-compatible alternative:** Search npm for modules specifically designed for Expo or that have been confirmed to work within Expo's managed workflow.

2. **Use a wrapper or bridge:** Some community-provided wrappers or bridges help integrate native modules into Expo's environment.  These act as intermediaries, easing communication between your JavaScript code and the native module. 

3. **Eject from Expo (least preferred):** Ejecting from the managed workflow to the bare workflow gives you full control over the native Android and iOS code. However, this significantly increases complexity.  You are responsible for managing native development on both platforms, leading to a more challenging development process.
