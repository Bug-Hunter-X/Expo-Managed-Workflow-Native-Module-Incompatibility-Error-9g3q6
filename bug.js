This error typically occurs when you're working with Expo's managed workflow and try to use native modules or features that aren't fully compatible with the managed workflow.  The specific error message might vary, but it usually points to an incompatibility between a native module and Expo's build system.  The error usually points towards trying to use a module that requires direct interaction with native Android or iOS code, something Expo's managed workflow usually handles abstractly.
